            Hi there! My name is Sandip and welcome to my learning journal.
          </p>
          <p class="main-article-desc">
            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
            Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code
            reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.
          </p>
          <div class="main-article-body">
            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>
              I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
              hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using
              what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what
              I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>
              I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I
              would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
              session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
              but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own
              words.
            </p>
            <p>
              That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that
              posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and
              stay motivated.
